The resolution comes after the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) said in a statement released also released on 21 March that the date for ruling on the matter had moved from 26 March 2019 to the “end of April 2019” as the parties involved had submitted new evidence for review. The adoption of this resolution was welcomed by South Africa, a feeling conveyed by the Department of International Relations and Co-operation (DIRCO). In a statement DIRCO lauded the fact that “the human rights system had taken a stance of holding international sport associations to account for their obligations under international human rights law.” “The international community has a duty to protect and defend the rights of Caster Semenya and other female athletes like her across the world, based on the premise that their human rights are being violated” said minister of International Relations and Co-operation Lindiwe Sisulu. The resolution was co-sponsored by eSwatini, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Burundi, India, Iceland and Canada; and Sisulu conveyed the gratitude of South Africa to these nations for their support, adding that “the international campaign to preserve Caster’s right to participate in global sports, is a struggle for all women in the world against discrimination, sexism, and patriarchy”. DM Watch Pauli van Wyk’s Cat Play The Piano Here! No, not really. But now that we have your attention, we wanted to tell you a little bit about what happened at SARS. Tom Moyane and his cronies bequeathed South Africa with a R48-billion tax shortfall, as of February 2018. It's the only thing that grew under Moyane's tenure... the year before, the hole had been R30.7-billion. And to fund those shortfalls, you know who has to cough up? You - the South African taxpayer. It was the sterling work of a team of investigative journalists, Scorpio’s Pauli van Wyk and Marianne Thamm along with our great friends at amaBhungane, that caused the SARS capturers to be finally flushed out of the system. Moyane, Makwakwa… the lot of them... gone. But our job is not yet done. We need more readers to become Maverick Insiders, the friends who will help ensure that many more investigations will come.

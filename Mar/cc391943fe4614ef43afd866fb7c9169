 Politically Aweh tries to tackle all of these questions in this video and discovers, in the process, that the outages are only the tip of the iceberg. A far more grave and permanent danger is threatening the existence of the world’s 11th largest power utility, and it is far from the only energy company facing a difficult future. Check out our report on the situation featuring an interview with energy and sustainability expert Lauren Hermanus as we try to answer all these questions in just eight minutes.

While not quite a "state of mind", it is a mindset: it's about believing that independent journalism makes a genuine difference to our country and it's about having the will to support that endeavour. From the #GuptaLeaks into State Capture to the Scorpio exposés into SARS, Daily Maverick investigations have made an enormous impact on South Africa and it's political landscape. As we enter an election year, our mission to Defend Truth has never been more important. A free press is one of the essential lines of defence against election fraud; without it, national polls can turn very nasty, very quickly as we have seen recently in the Congo.

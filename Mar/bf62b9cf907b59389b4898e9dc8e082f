KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Thulani Zwane told News24 that it happened just after midnight. “The trucks were set alight by unknown people who were threatening the drivers. They told the drivers to get out before, and then they set alight the trucks.” Zwane said a case of public violence has been opened at the Mooi River police station. The N3 between Mooi River and Estcourt remained closed on Thursday morning. “No one has been injured and no arrests have been made,” Zwane said. “We don’t know what the motive was.” Zwane said traffic is being diverted to other routes. DM Watch Pauli van Wyk’s Cat Play The Piano Here! No, not really. But now that we have your attention, we wanted to tell you a little bit about what happened at SARS. Tom Moyane and his cronies bequeathed South Africa with a R48-billion tax shortfall, as of February 2018. It's the only thing that grew under Moyane's tenure... the year before, the hole had been R30.7-billion. And to fund those shortfalls, you know who has to cough up? You - the South African taxpayer. It was the sterling work of a team of investigative journalists, Scorpio’s Pauli van Wyk and Marianne Thamm along with our great friends at amaBhungane, that caused the SARS capturers to be finally flushed out of the system. Moyane, Makwakwa… the lot of them... gone. But our job is not yet done. We need more readers to become Maverick Insiders, the friends who will help ensure that many more investigations will come.

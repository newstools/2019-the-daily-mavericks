Cape Town, Thursday 06 September 2019, March to Parliament (Photo: Nicky Newman)  “We were shocked out of our numbness by the rape and murder of UCT student Uyinene Mrwetyana at a post office, right next to a police station, after a week-long, highly publicised search. “One young man held a small placard saying ‘lost lives are not statistics’ and Uyinene was the proverbial last straw, becoming the face of a united campaign to end gender-based violence,” says Newman. There is a barefoot walk in the Cape Town Company Gardens this Saturday, 28 September at 11am as the mass action continues.

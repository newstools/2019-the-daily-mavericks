This comes after Dlamini saw a report from the publication describing how she was heckled and chased away after she – together with the ANCWL – showed up to the protest in party regalia.  2 Dlamini was initially whisked away as protesters got agitated by her presence, but apparently returned later when they calmed down, according to News24’s reporter on the scene.  1 In a video posted on Twitter, Dlamini seems unperturbed by the heckling. A man asks her: “Do you feel welcome by the protesters here?” She responds by waving the camera away.  1 Protesters assembled outside the stock exchange in the early hours of Friday in the continued fight against gender-based violence and femicide. The march follows a series of protests under the hashtag #AmINext following the murders of young women in South Africa, including Uyinene Mrwetyana, Leighandre Jegels, Meghan Cremer and Ayakha Jiyane and her three siblings – all acts of gender-based violence.  2 News24 Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.

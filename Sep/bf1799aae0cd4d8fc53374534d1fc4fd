Tariffs on some goods was delayed to Dec. 15. Trump later announced a two-week delay on increasing existing tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods to 30% from 25%, which is now set for Oct. 15. China’s Mighty Trade Engine Is Stalling as Negotiators Seek Deal China has targeted U.S. exports including agriculture products with retaliatory tariffs, hitting farmers who are also dealing with unpredictable weather and low commodity prices.

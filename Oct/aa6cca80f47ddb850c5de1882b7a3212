With a drop off in exports to the U.S. expected to continue as the trade war hits, the economy is likely to continue struggling as deflationary pressures hit company profits. Even with the slowdown, year to date growth of 6.2% suggests the government can hit its 6% and 6.5% for 2019. Until now, officials have focused on limited, targeted measures such as reserve-ratio cuts and credit support, wary of expanding the nation’s already heavy debt load. “Momentum has been easing since the second half of 2018, driven by industrial weakness and moderating consumer demand,” said Li Wei, a senior economist at Standard Chartered Plc in Shanghai. “The protracted U.S.-China dispute, which now goes well beyond just trade, has hit the sentiment badly.

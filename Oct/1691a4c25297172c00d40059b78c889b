Captain FC van Wyk said a warder raised the alarm at about 01:00 that two people had cut electrical wires surrounding the Medium B prison, on the side of the premises where the sports field is situated.  3 A warder had been sitting in a lookout point when he spotted them. They tried to get into his lookout post and were surprised to find him in there.  2 “One of the suspects was already halfway inside the lookout post when the warder confronted him,” said Van Wyk.  1 “The two became involved in a [scuffle] and the warder took the backpack which the suspect had in his hand.”  1 The jail breakers ran away, leaving the bag behind.  1 The warder found 350 mandrax tablets rolled up similar to rolls of sucking sweets, a rope, and a side cutter inside the backpack. The police and the Department of Correctional Services patrolled the prison and surrounding area in search of the two. They are still at large.  1 News24 Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment. Sign up here or sign in if you are already an Insider.

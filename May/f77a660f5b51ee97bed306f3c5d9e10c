Out of the eight South Africans who started the tournament, only three made the cut for the weekend. Van Rooyen, who was making his PGA Championship debut, carded a three-over par 73 on Sunday to finish at 1-over for the tournament. He finished tied for eighth, nine shots behind eventual champion Brooks Koepka, who defended his title. The 29-year-old banked a cool $ 264 395 (R3.8 million) for his four-day efforts. Van Rooyen also broke into the Top 100 in the latest world rankings by moving up 17 places to 89th. Meanwhile, Justin Harding posted a 2-over 72 in his final round to finish T54 on 9-over for the tournament and banked $22 850 (R330 000). SA’s top-ranked golfer Louis Oosthuizen had a final round to forget as he posted a 9-over 79 to finish tied for 60th at 10-over. Oosthuizen took home $21 300 (R305 000). Branden Grace , Dylan Frittelli , Shaun Norris , Brandon Stone and Richard Sterne were the five South Africans who failed to make the weekend.

Who doesn’t? Alas, it was removed by the host site for prolific swearing*... Now that we’ve got your attention, we thought we’d take the opportunity to talk to you about the small matter of book burning and freedom of speech. Since its release, Pieter-Louis Myburgh’s book Gangster State, has sparked numerous fascist-like behavior from certain members of the public (and the State). There have been planned book burnings, disrupted launches and Ace Magashule has openly called him a liar. And just to say thanks, a R10m defamation suit has been lodged against the author. Pieter-Louis Myburgh is our latest Scorpio Investigative journalist recruit and we’re not going to let him and his crucial book be silenced. When the Cape Town launch was postponed, Maverick Insider stepped in and relocated it to a secure location so that Pieter-Louis’ revelations could be heard by the public. If we’ve learnt one thing over the past ten years it is this: when anyone tries to infringe on our constitutional rights, we have to fight back. Every day, our journalists are uncovering more details and evidence of State Capture and its various reincarnations. The rot is deep and the threats, like this recent one to freedom of speech, are real. You can support the cause by becoming an Insider and help free the speech that can make a difference. *No video of Richard Poplak auditioning for SA’s Got Talent actually exists.

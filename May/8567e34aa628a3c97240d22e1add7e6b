Lamu Island: Picture Erik Hersman, Wikimedia Commons, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license. The four farmers are waiting beneath a tree when we arrive. It is February, which means that it is almost time for the rainy season in Kenya and they have started the process of clearing the land for planting. It is uncomfortably humid in Lamu County where we are, but beneath the tree, one of the region’s majestic baobabs, a light breeze cools us. The farmers practise a form of subsistence agriculture called slash-and-burn – a traditional method of clearing wild areas to plant crops – and, on our journey from Mokowe to meet them, we have passed the occasional controlled fire, which family groups are using to clear the coastal bush. We have also passed abandoned homesteads which have belonged to these farming families for many generations. The farmers have since fled onto nearby islands due to terrorism threats from al-Shabaab insurgents. North of us is the Somalian border and the armed struggle between Kenya and Somalia is leaking into the area. Although the mainland continues to be unsafe, the farmers still traverse the bay in order to tend to their farms. While the houses themselves are slowly being reclaimed by the tropical vegetation so typical of the coastal belt of Kenya, my colleague assures me that on each parcel of land, cashew nuts, maize, watermelons, pawpaws (papaya) and other crops are flourishing. While they have adapted their way of life to accommodate the terrorism, there is a new threat that will change their way of life completely; the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport, or Lapsset, development, a massive corridor development incorporating Lamu Port, highways, a standard gauge railway, a gas line, airports and even the development of three entirely new resort cities. The farmers we are meeting are some of those that my colleague, Said, a community environmental legal officer at Natural Justice, regularly consults with. Sometimes he brings them updates about the Lapsset project or feedback from meetings with government officials. On this day, he wants the farmers to meet his colleagues from South Africa. We talk about their lives, how they are faring, their future concerns. What we learn is that there is a heightened level of uncertainty among the farmers. The port development has been lauded by its supporters, including the Kenyan government, as the economic emancipation of the people of Lamu, bringing relief to an area that has relied almost exclusively on fisheries, tourism and agriculture – industries that have suffered under threats of al-Shabaab. But the port has caused disruptions to the local people’s livelihoods and the future, for them, feels largely unknown. The port’s controversial cousin is the Lamu Coal Power Plant facility. This aspect of the LAPSSET project has garnered a lot of resistance from the local community. The farm we are currently sitting on has been cut through by a road to the site where the future coal plant will be developed. When we visit the site later that day, there is nothing to see and you can barely tell the site exists. It’s a disconcerting feeling. Natural undergrowth has covered over the site markers. In the near distance, you can see the sea. The water that will assist to cool the plant will be syphoned from the ocean, and the heated water pumped back in, altering the ecology of the marine life in the immediate vicinity. Already the port development has severely affected the fish populations and the coral reefs have been destroyed. A court case last year, while able to get compensation for the local fishers who have been affected, also showed that the port development went ahead without adequate constitutional considerations and violated the community’s rights. As I write this, it has been a year since the judgment was handed down. The court judgment was notable for its emphasis on public participation when development is carried out, and gave directions on how public participation should be conducted as part of the environmental and social assessment processes. This would have been a crucial first step to overcoming rights’ violations, but, as was expected, the ruling was appealed. Rights violations continue. From Said’s descriptions and from talking to the farmers, I am of the view that what has transpired in Lamu County is the disregard for the people who have occupied this land for decades. Just a few weeks before our meeting under the trees, Said was urgently contacted by a farmer whose land lies close to the current Port development. The farmer explained to Said how earlier that day he had found part of his land bulldozed. The operators, who were sent by the Port Authority to clear the land, told the farmer that they were assured that “nobody lives there”. With support from others, the farmer physically blocked the bulldozers, calling Said for assistance. After Said took pictures of the bulldozers and sent them to the National Environmental Management Authority, they were able to put a temporary stop to further clearing. But it’s just a matter of time before port operations will continue. Later that day, we meet with other members of the farming community. They show us a lease agreement that was unearthed during the initiation of litigation against the port development. No one but the signees knew of its contents, not even the farmers. The lease shows that a 27,000-acre piece of land was leased to the Port Development Authority in 2015, a much larger amount than the roughly 393-acres previously thought. The farmers have challenged this lease in the courts. Issues around land rights have been a source of growing tensions in the area since the Lapsset development began. Farmers and local communities have accused external people and connected government people of claiming their land. This issue is compounded by the lack of land rights for the indigenous occupants. Said tells us that many farmers in the area are aware that they will be giving up their land to the port development and that there is nothing that can be done about it. But, although resigned to their fate, they still have one card up their sleeve and that is compensation. I ask Said whether the farmers we are talking to, older men reaching retirement, care that their children will not be able to follow in their footsteps. But this kind of discussion has no place here. The bigger question occupying their minds is how to assert their ownership and get title deeds. With these title deeds, they are in a better position to bargain for “just and fair” compensation – they have already learnt the legal terminology. Elsewhere in Lamu, there is some hope that the Kenyan government is heeding the call for strengthening the land rights of local communities. In nearby Boni, indigenous forest dwellers (the Aweer) have been issued with 3,232 title deeds, which will put local people in a better position to negotiate compensation or fight to keep their land. It has taken the government 56 years to heed the call. The Boni land is currently the site of numerous Lapsset projects, including a highway, pipeline, oil refinery and industrial city. As we brave the dust and heat on the trip back to the jetty, where our boat will take us back to Lamu Town, I take in the changes to the land. Electricity pylons stretch as far as the eye can see, running in parallel to a wide and precarious dirt road which will connect the port to various destinations in Kenya, but also to neighbouring states. This is, after all, going to be one of the biggest ports in east and southern Africa after those in South Africa. What has bothered me the most on this trip is a certain phrasing I have heard three times in relation to developments in Kenya, “No one lives here”. It’s as if those behind these developments have relegated the farmers, fishers and the local communities to being invisible people. It is obviously easier to believe that people don’t exist rather than to engage with them in any meaningful way. What has been conveniently forgotten is that land is not just a piece of ground, but a connection to the soil, to the community, and to livelihoods. Tired and dusty from our trip to visit the Lamu farmers, I start to think about roads. In Mokowe, where new government buildings have been erected to support the port development, the tarring of a small stretch of road was a cause of curiosity and delight for local inhabitants, who all wanted to experience what it felt like to drive on a smooth surface. But roads are only built for one purpose, to connect one thing to another. Clearly, before the port development, no one thought that Mokowe deserved to be connected to anything else. I get the same feeling in Lamu Town while walking through its narrow streets, eating at its restaurants and gazing out at the beauty of the bay surrounding it. Just close by, the area of Shela contains the holiday homes of the mega-rich and offers snorkelling and sunset tours, but none of this affluence can be seen in Lamu Town, despite its Unesco World Heritage Site status. Currently, Lamu Town is on the threatened list, but with the proliferation of the Lapsset developments threatening the cultural diversity and local livelihoods, activists are calling for it to be placed on the endangered list. Before Lapsset, Mokowe and the greater Lamu area had no value to the Kenyan government, which has put very little into developing the area. But now local communities’ way of life is threatened in the name of profit – and the threat is imposed by a government which does not see them. DM Claire Martens is Senior Communications Officer at Natural Justice. Want to watch Richard Poplak’s audition for SA’s Got Talent? Who doesn’t? Alas, it was removed by the host site for prolific swearing*... Now that we’ve got your attention, we thought we’d take the opportunity to talk to you about the small matter of book burning and freedom of speech. Since its release, Pieter-Louis Myburgh’s book Gangster State, has sparked numerous fascist-like behavior from certain members of the public (and the State). There have been planned book burnings, disrupted launches and Ace Magashule has openly called him a liar. And just to say thanks, a R10m defamation suit has been lodged against the author. Pieter-Louis Myburgh is our latest Scorpio Investigative journalist recruit and we’re not going to let him and his crucial book be silenced. When the Cape Town launch was postponed, Maverick Insider stepped in and relocated it to a secure location so that Pieter-Louis’ revelations could be heard by the public. If we’ve learnt one thing over the past ten years it is this: when anyone tries to infringe on our constitutional rights, we have to fight back. Every day, our journalists are uncovering more details and evidence of State Capture and its various reincarnations. The rot is deep and the threats, like this recent one to freedom of speech, are real. You can support the cause by becoming an Insider and help free the speech that can make a difference. *No video of Richard Poplak auditioning for SA’s Got Talent actually exists.

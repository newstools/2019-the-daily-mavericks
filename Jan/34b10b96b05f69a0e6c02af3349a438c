Explosions have been heard above Syria’s capital Damascus, according to SANA. The “Israeli enemy dealt a heavy strike,” according to SANA, through successive waves of guided missiles. “Our air defenses immediately dealt with the situation and intercepted the hostile missiles and destroyed most of them before reaching their goals,” the news service reported.

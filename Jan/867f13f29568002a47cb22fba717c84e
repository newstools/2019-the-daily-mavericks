Both eNCA and Open News reported that a high-level delegation of officials visited the school and asked the teacher to temporarily step aside.  4 A meeting between the education department, the school and the community was still ongoing at 12:00 on Thursday. Speaking to News24, education department spokesperson Freddy Sepeng said officials were still locked in a meeting at 12:00. “We are still very busy,” he said. Earlier, parents were also contacted to remove their children from the school after protests erupted outside the premises on Thursday morning.  5 The North West Education MEC and other officials visited the school following public outrage over a photograph that surfaced online on the first day of school. A picture showing about four black pupils seated separately at a desk from a larger group of white pupils at another desk, went viral on social media. The mother of a Grade R pupil was fuming, TimesLive reported. The class teacher shared the photograph on the school’s WhatsApp group. The mother reportedly received it from the class teacher at around 09:00 as an update of the children’s day.

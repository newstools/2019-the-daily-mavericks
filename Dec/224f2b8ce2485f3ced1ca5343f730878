Shaw, 24, arrived at the Premier League club’s Carrington training complex with around 50 of the gift baskets, which are worth more than 250 pounds ($320) each. It is not the first time Shaw has shown such generosity, with the England international having ordered hampers filled with luxury items over the last two years as a token of appreciation for the work done behind the scenes.

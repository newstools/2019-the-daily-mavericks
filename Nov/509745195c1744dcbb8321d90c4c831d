The Boks famously beat England 32-12 in the final last week and joined New Zealand as three-time RWC winners. Siya Kolisi became the first black player to lift the trophy, while the Boks cemented their place as the first team to lose a Pool match before winning the title. The Springboks were also the first team to win the Rugby Championship (and its predecessor the Tri-Nations) in the same year as winning the World Cup. They ended the year ranked number one on World Rugby’s official ranking. So far, the Springboks’ victory tour has taken them through Pretoria, Johannesburg, Soweto, Durban, East London and Port Elizabeth, including Kolisi’s hometown of Zwide.  On Monday the parade will move through Cape Town’s centre, starting at City Hall, before heading out to Langa and the Cape Flats. These are the final routes of their whirlwind five-day tour through South Africa.   DM   Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment. Sign up here or sign in if you are already an Insider.

An investigation is underway to determine what went wrong, Dutch military police said. “In a plane (set to fly) from Amsterdam to Madrid tonight an alarm was accidentally activated which set off safety protocols at the airport,” Spanish-owned Air Europa said. “There was no cause for alarm. All passengers were fine and waiting for the flight to take off.” It added: “We are sorry. There was no cause for alarm.” (Reporting by Bart Meijer and Anthony Deutsch Editing by Mark Heinrich and Lisa Shumaker) Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.

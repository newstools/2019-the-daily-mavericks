Iraqis have taken to the street in their thousands to demand the departure of their government and political class which they view as corrupt and beholden to foreign powers, especially neighbouring Iran.

Iranian-backed parties and paramilitary groups dominate state institutions and parliament. (Reporting by John Davison and Alaa Swilam) Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.

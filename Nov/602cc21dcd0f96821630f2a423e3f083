Leaders felt there was still a lot to be done in my own province. If there is enough reason for me to consider becoming a national leader, maybe I should do it for May next year,” he told News24.  3 This leaves current parliamentary leader John Steenhuisen and newly-elected chairperson of the members of provincial legislature network, Makashule Gana, in the race.  2 The DA will hold a federal council meeting over the weekend to elect an interim leader and interim chairperson.  2 Last month, former federal leader Mmusi Maimane and ex-federal chair Athol Trollip announced their resignations from their positions.  2 Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba also resigned from the party days earlier.  2 News24  1 Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.

A picture taken with a drone shows a giant biodegradable landart painting by French-Swiss artist Saype, titled 'The Smugglers of Friendship!' ('Les contrebandiers de l'amitie!' in french) in front of Les Dents du Midi mountains in the Swiss-French ski area Portes du soleil, in Les Crosets, Vall d'Illiez, Switzerland, 10 July 2019. With an overall area of 2,500 square meters, the painting was created using biodegradable pigments made out of charcoal, chalk, water and milk proteins and made to symbolize France-Swiss friendship. Four working days and between 800 and 1,000 liters of a mixture of water and natural pigments were required. EPA-EFE/LAURENT GILLIERON In other news...

“We will not abandon the path of political negotiation, and we will not drop the path of peaceful escalation,” Madani Abbas Madani, a leader of the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC), told a news conference in Khartoum. The FFC, which organised a massive show of force on Sunday when tens of thousands of people took to the streets, said it was calling for another mass march on July 13 and a day of civil disobedience on July 14. Madani said nine people were killed during Sunday’s protests and some 200 were injured. (Reporting by Khalid Abdelaziz; writing by Sami Aboudi, editing by Jonathan Oatis) In other news...

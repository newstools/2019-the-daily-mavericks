“It is not fully appreciated, this doesn’t end on Oct. 31. Some people I know have become weary of Brexit and may take the view that this should end on Oct. 31, with either a deal or no-deal,” Varadkar told journalists in Hillsborough Castle near Belfast. “If there is no deal, then at a certain point we will have to begin negotiations again, and the first items on the agenda will be citizens’ rights, the financial settlement and the solution to the Irish border.” “No deal doesn’t kill the backstop.” (Reporting by Conor Humphries; Editing by Alison Williams) In other news... South Africa is in a very real battle. A political fight where terms such as truth and democracy can seem more of a suggestion as opposed to a necessity. On one side of the battle are those openly willing to undermine the sovereignty of a democratic society, completely disregarding the weight and power of the oaths declared when they took office. If their mission was to decrease society’s trust in government - mission accomplished. And on the other side are those who believe in the ethos of a country whose constitution was once declared the most progressive in the world. The hope that truth, justice and accountability in politics, business and society is not simply fairy tale dust sprinkled in great electoral speeches; but rather a cause that needs to be intentionally acted upon every day. However, it would be an offensive oversight not to acknowledge that right there on the front lines, alongside whistleblowers and civil society, stand the journalists. Armed with only their determination to inform society and defend the truth, caught in the crossfire of shots fired from both sides.

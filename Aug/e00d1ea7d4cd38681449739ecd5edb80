On Wednesday, King, an Iowa Republican who has been stripped of his committee assignments for his history of offensive comments, expressed his opposition to exceptions for rape and incest in anti-abortion legislation by saying that humanity might not exist if rape and incest did not occur, according to the Des Moines Register. Many of the Democrats running for president, including Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker, immediately said that King should resign, and some posted a link to donate to J.D. Scholten, the Democrat who is challenging King again after narrowly losing to him in 2018. Many Democrats had previously called for King to resign earlier this year after comments he made to The New York Times questioning why the term white supremacy was offensive. Beto O’Rourke says he’ll return to the presidential campaign trail after taking more than a week off in the aftermath of the mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso.
O’Rourke’s campaign announced he’ll give the “first major address” of his flagging presidential effort Thursday in El Paso, outlining the path forward for his candidacy. Earlier this month, a gunman killed 22 people and injured 24 at a Walmart in El Paso. Just before the shooting, the suspect posted a manifesto online in which he denounced immigration and wrote that “this attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.” O’Rourke entered the presidential contest with sky-high expectations after a narrow loss to Ted Cruz in a 2018 Senate race. However, O’Rourke has failed to gain much traction in the race, and many Democrats have pushed him to drop out of the race and run for the Senate against John Cornyn in 2020. The Trump campaign is putting an early focus on New Hampshire, site of the nation’s first presidential primary election, setting up campaign staff even though the president is virtually unopposed.
A rally by President Donald Trump on Thursday comes as Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren campaign in the state this week. His campaign announced Wednesday that the Republican National Committee and campaign had put in place a political director, state director, and three Trump campaign chairs. The stated goal of the team is “up and down ballot” victories in 2020, according to Trump Campaign manager Brad Parscale in the announcement, where he also sought to cast the election as a contest between “socialist government takeover” and Trump. Sanders calls himself a socialist, and Warren’s policies are left of Democratic Party norms. Elissa Voccola and Eric Mitchell will serve in RNC director roles in New Hampshire while Fred Doucette, Al Baldasaro, and Lou Gargiulo will serve as Trump campaign chairs in the critical state. — Alyza Sebenius Michael Bennet has a different strategy for pitching his case to be president: If elected, you just might not see him for weeks at a time.
“Watching Donald Trump’s presidency is like watching one of those car accidents you can’t take you eyes away from,” the U.S. senator from Colorado told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Wednesday. The Democratic candidate — who has not yet made the cut off for the next debates — said Trump was “wasting everybody’s time” with his “endless reality TV show.” Bennet said Trump has “exhausted all of us and I think its just time to move on.” Bennet wrote on Twitter last week that if elected president, “I promise you won’t have to think about me for 2 weeks at a time. I’ll do my job watching out for North Korea and ending this trade war. So you can go raise your kids and live your lives.” — Terrence Dopp * President Donald Trump holds a “Keep America Great” rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Thursday.

A political fight where terms such as truth and democracy can seem more of a suggestion as opposed to a necessity. On one side of the battle are those openly willing to undermine the sovereignty of a democratic society, completely disregarding the weight and power of the oaths declared when they took office. If their mission was to decrease society’s trust in government - mission accomplished. And on the other side are those who believe in the ethos of a country whose constitution was once declared the most progressive in the world. The hope that truth, justice and accountability in politics, business and society is not simply fairy tale dust sprinkled in great electoral speeches; but rather a cause that needs to be intentionally acted upon every day. However, it would be an offensive oversight not to acknowledge that right there on the front lines, alongside whistleblowers and civil society, stand the journalists. Armed with only their determination to inform society and defend the truth, caught in the crossfire of shots fired from both sides.

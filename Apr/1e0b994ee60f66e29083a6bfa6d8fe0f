The announcement was made at a media briefing where Nzimande revealed that the interim Prasa board would be retained for another six months. Initially, Thursday’s media briefing about the embattled rail agency was due to take place after ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa became stuck on a train for nearly three hours in Tshwane in March 2019. Nzimande’s office called a media briefing for 25 March, but that was postponed. However, following Ramaphosa’s attendance at the launch of two new trains in Cape Town on Tuesday, his presidential motorcade was blocked by commuter activist group #UniteBehind. The activists used the opportunity to ask the president to address State Capture at the rail agency, the lack of a commuter safety plan and called for the declaration of rail as a national disaster.

Nzimande announced that he “will be extending the current Prasa board term by six months” before its expiry on 30 April 2019. The interim board, led by Khanyisile Kweyama, labelled as “Madam Fix It” by Parliament’s transport committee, was appointed in April 2018, soon after Nzimande’s own appointment in the February 2018 Cabinet reshuffle. Among the issues the interim board needs to finalise is vacant senior positions at Prasa, including the appointment of a permanent CEO, who was scheduled to be appointed by the end of April, according to Business Day. According to Nzimande, the board has been directed to focus on key operational issues, including to “improve the reliability of trains and revise the train timetable based on the availability of trains”. During the 2019-20 financial year, the board must focus on securing trains and passengers by deploying security personnel on trains and the fencing or walling of corridors and depots in all regions, said Nzimande. Nzimande said that in addition to the new trains tested Cape Town, 30 new trains will be tested in Gauteng, as well as another 30 to be tested in KwaZulu-Natal. Additionally, Nzimande announced: “I will be appointing a team of organisational or performance experts to undertake a six-to-eight-week organisational analysis of Prasa.” The team is expected to present a report to the minister, addressing the factors that could have led to the failed implementation of Prasa’s turnaround strategies. DM Watch Pauli van Wyk’s Cat Play The Piano Here! No, not really. But now that we have your attention, we wanted to tell you a little bit about what happened at SARS. Tom Moyane and his cronies bequeathed South Africa with a R48-billion tax shortfall, as of February 2018. It's the only thing that grew under Moyane's tenure... the year before, the hole had been R30.7-billion. And to fund those shortfalls, you know who has to cough up? You - the South African taxpayer. It was the sterling work of a team of investigative journalists, Scorpio’s Pauli van Wyk and Marianne Thamm along with our great friends at amaBhungane, that caused the SARS capturers to be finally flushed out of the system. Moyane, Makwakwa… the lot of them... gone. But our job is not yet done. We need more readers to become Maverick Insiders, the friends who will help ensure that many more investigations will come.

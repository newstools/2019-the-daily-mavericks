This difficult decision was made after Sam sought advice from medical specialists and his team, and after having to cut his show short on Tuesday night with concerns for his voice. Sam is deeply upset that he is unable to perform for his fans in Cape Town but needs to rest at this time. Big Concerts wished Sam a speedy recovery and hopes to welcome him back to Cape Town in the future.

But now that we have your attention, we wanted to tell you a little bit about what happened at SARS. Tom Moyane and his cronies bequeathed South Africa with a R48-billion tax shortfall, as of February 2018. It's the only thing that grew under Moyane's tenure... the year before, the hole had been R30.7-billion. And to fund those shortfalls, you know who has to cough up? You - the South African taxpayer. It was the sterling work of a team of investigative journalists, Scorpio’s Pauli van Wyk and Marianne Thamm along with our great friends at amaBhungane, that caused the SARS capturers to be finally flushed out of the system. Moyane, Makwakwa… the lot of them... gone. But our job is not yet done. We need more readers to become Maverick Insiders, the friends who will help ensure that many more investigations will come.

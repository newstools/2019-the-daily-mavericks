Where two rivers meet: The man-made 'Kak' river from the Zandvliet WWTW meets the Kuils River.

We point out that current City water quality data is neither publicly available nor peer-reviewed. Instead of responding to the reasoned questions we pose about why a premier independent water quality laboratory in Cape Town could find such high levels of E.coli and Enterococcus, the City has chosen to use its Right of Reply to attack our integrity as scientists. The claim that we have been alarmists who caused panic in the media is false. Our concerns about algal blooms were raised not in the media, but by telephone and email to the Western Cape Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning after analysis of satellite data from a fellow scientist suggested that blooms were a toxic variety. We requested an urgent on-the-ground investigation to confirm the satellite image analysis. The emails noted a link between harmful algal blooms and possible marine mortalities. To imply we prophesied mass deaths — by implication, human — is fallacious. The Cape Argus article claiming cholera on the beaches was retracted, corrected and republished in full by Independent Media, acknowledging that its staff had erred. Within hours of the Cape Argus “cholera” claim, we arranged for UCT Media and Communications to issue a press statement to all media houses noting that the story was incorrect and should not be republished. These points were discussed with three of the five authors of this article in a meeting in January, and the emails and articles they wrongfully cite are in their possession. Further distortions, distractions and falsehoods are evident throughout the text of the “Right of Reply”. It serves no purpose to enter into line-by-line refutation. We call on the authors Xanthea Limberg, Gisela Kaiser, Peter Flower, Gregg Oelofse and Clive Justus to commit themselves to ethical, truthful and evidence-based governance, and address the problem at Sandvlei. The salient facts are that the Zandvliet Waste Water Treatment Works is 10 years behind its scheduled upgrade; that the inaction of the City’s water and sanitation division in respect of Sandvlei has been the focus of critical reports by the Department of the Environment nationally, and by the equivalent ministry in the Western Cape; that the City is facing a criminal charge laid by the Sandvlei community in terms of the National Environmental Management Act. Whether or not the treatment works is responsible for the pollution in the Kuils River, requires the proper independent investigation we called for in our article. As taxpayer-funded researchers, our team will continue to exercise academic freedom to work alongside a community in order to understand why they are suffering a complex health and environmental crisis, in a context in which their relationship with the City has broken down. We remain available to work with the City as we do so. Ratepayers’ money, in this situation, is better spent in laboratories than on lawyers. It is cheaper to rebuild relationships with a community than go to court. It is not too late for City water officials to change course.

Watch Pauli van Wyk’s Cat Play The Piano Here! No, not really. But now that we have your attention, we wanted to tell you a little bit about what happened at SARS. Tom Moyane and his cronies bequeathed South Africa with a R48-billion tax shortfall, as of February 2018. It's the only thing that grew under Moyane's tenure... the year before, the hole had been R30.7-billion. And to fund those shortfalls, you know who has to cough up? You - the South African taxpayer. It was the sterling work of a team of investigative journalists, Scorpio’s Pauli van Wyk and Marianne Thamm along with our great friends at amaBhungane, that caused the SARS capturers to be finally flushed out of the system. Moyane, Makwakwa… the lot of them... gone. But our job is not yet done. We need more readers to become Maverick Insiders, the friends who will help ensure that many more investigations will come. Contributions go directly towards growing our editorial team and ensuring that Daily Maverick and Scorpio have a sustainable future. We can’t rely on advertising and don't want to restrict access to only those who can afford a paywall subscription. Membership is about more than just contributing financially – it is about how we Defend Truth, together. So, if you feel so inclined, and would like a way to support the cause, please join our community of Maverick Insiders.... you could view it as the opposite of a sin tax. And if you are already Maverick Insider, tell your mother, call a friend, whisper to your loved one, shout at your boss, write to a stranger, announce it on your social network.

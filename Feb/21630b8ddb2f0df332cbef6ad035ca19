South African President Cyril Ramaphosa arrives to deliver the State Of The Nation Address (SONA) in parliament, Cape Town, South Africa, 07 February 2019. EPA-EFE/RODGER BOSCH / POOL                                 Less This article first appeared here The main events will be the joint debate on the State of the Nation Address on Tuesday and Wednesday as well as the President’s reply on Thursday. The debate allows the opposition to give a rebuttal to the President’s speech and is a highlight of the parliamentary calendar as all party leaders and a galaxy of heavyweight MPs take part.  1 The debate follows a predictable path: the opposition attacks the President and governing party for not offering new ideas and highlights all their failures. In return, the governing party defends the President, the government’s record and proposals and points out weaknesses in the opposition. Speaker after speaker bear their political fangs and the presiding officers are severely tested as they try to maintain control. With an election just months away, it is inevitable that there will be even more jibes, rhetoric and heckling than the norm. While most of the attention will be focused on the plenary proceedings, the committee corridor has also scheduled a number of meetings that will generate attention. Here is a run-down of some of the most interesting meetings: The Department of Basic Education will brief lawmakers on the state of school readiness for 2019. The briefing is usually wide-ranging covering topics like learner admissions and registration, undocumented learners, teacher provisioning, learning and teaching support materials, basic infrastructure and learner transport. The department will also present on the outcomes of the National Senior Certificate examination. (Tuesday and Wednesday)  1  The Portfolio Committee on Police will evaluate the current anti-gang strategy of the SAPS at its first meeting of 2019. Civil society groups and community leaders from Gauteng, the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and Free State have been invited to the meeting to give testimony on their experiences and concerns about law enforcement in gang infested areas. Also on the agenda is an engagement with Metro Police Chiefs on Budget/Structure/Performance and High Profile cases.

MPs will look to tackle these issues as they meet to discuss the current impasse and strategies in place to ensure that the academic programme in not halted.

Less This article was first published on the PMG site On Wednesday, the leader of government business will have his regular engagement with lawmakers when he appears to answer oral questions. These sessions happen once per month, are three hours long and are limited to six main and supplementary questions. In addition, the questions must be restricted to matters of national and international importance, as assigned to the Deputy President by the President. Currently, the Deputy President is responsible for, among other things, social cohesion, the moral regeneration movement, manages the interaction between the Executive and Parliament, is special envoy to South Sudan and is chairperson of the South African Aids Council and Human Resource Development Council so most of the questions touch on these themes.  1 Government Ministers may make oral statements to Parliament which usually address major incidents, government policies or actions. Each political party is allowed an opportunity to respond to such a statement. On Wednesday, the Minister of Science and Technology will make a statement on the Space Weather Centre. Last month, it was announced that the South African National Space Agency was chosen to provide space weather information for the continent. On the following day, the Minister of Sports and Recreation will make a statement in support of the Caster Semenya campaign against the IAAF Hyperandrogenism Regulations. The Rules allow MPs to propose a subject for discussion – this mechanism provides an opportunity for the House to debate a particular topic without being required to take a decision at the end of the debate. Unemployment, the economy and job losses are recurring debate topics. This time, the leader of the opposition proposed the following debate for discussion: solutions to address job losses in South Africa and the Gross Domestic Product growth forecast decline for 2019. Also dotting the NA plenary agenda are regular items like legislation, consideration of committee reports and international instruments, members’ statements, motions without notice and notices of Motion. Elsewhere, the NCOP chamber has arranged one sitting where it will consider multiple reports including the Taking Parliament to the People Report. This event took place in Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality in 2018 and the new Parliament will be expected to do a follow-up visit to make sure the commitments are being carried out.

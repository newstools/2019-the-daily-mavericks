While it prepared for the worst in the UK, the Paris-based conglomerate enjoyed solid growth in all regions last quarter. In particular, the company cited strength for wine and spirits in China, where consumers have been snapping up its Hennessy and Dom Pérignon. – Bloomberg DM Are You A South AfriCAN or a South AfriCAN'T?
